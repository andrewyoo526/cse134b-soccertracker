            <p id="Pogba" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%; margin: 0 20px;">Pogba</p>
            <p>Paul Labile Pogba (born 15 March 1993) is a French professional footballer who plays for Premier League club Manchester United and the France national team. He operates primarily as a central midfielder and is comfortable playing both in attack and defence.</p>

            <p>After beginning his career with Manchester United in 2011, Pogba joined Italian side Juventus in 2012, and helped the club to four consecutive Serie A titles, as well as two Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. During his time with the club, he established himself as one of the most promising young players in the world, and received the Golden Boy award in 2013, followed by the Bravo Award in 2014 and was named by The Guardian as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year as well as the 2015 FIFA FIFPro World XI, after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final. Despite leaving Manchester United on a free transfer, Pogba returned to the club in 2016 for a then-world record transfer fee of €105 million (£89.3 million).</p>

            <p>Internationally, at under-20 level, he captained his nation to victory at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup and took home the Best Player award for his performances during the tournament. He made his debut for the senior French national team on 22 March 2013 in a 3–1 win against Georgia, and scored his first World Cup goal on 30 June 2014 against Nigeria; he was awarded the Best Young Player Award for his performances at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, after reaching the quarter-final. He later represented his nation at UEFA Euro 2016 on home soil, where he scored one goal as his team reached the final.</p>

            
            <p id="Aguero" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%; margin: 0 20px;">Sergio Aguero</p>
            <p>Sergio Leonel "Kun" Aguero  (born 2 June 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Manchester City and the Argentina national team.</p>

            <p>Aguero began his career at Independiente. On 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to debut in the Argentine Primera División at 15 years and 35 days, breaking the record previously established by Diego Maradona in 1976. In 2006, Aguero moved to Europe to play for La Liga side Atletico Madrid, for a transfer fee of €23 million. He made a name for himself, attracting attention from Europe's top clubs by scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances while winning the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010.</p>

            <p>Aguero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of £35 million. On the last day of his debut season with the club, Aguero scored a 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2014–15 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Aguero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 109 minutes. He also holds the joint-record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match – five – and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time. He is the highest non-European scorer in the history of the Premier League, and reached 100 goals in the division faster than any player other than Alan Shearer.</p>
            
            <p>At international level, Aguero represented the Argentina under-20 team at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2005 and in 2007, winning both tournaments. Aguero played at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, scoring two goals in the 3–0 semi-final win against Brazil as Argentina went on to win the gold medal. Aguero was selected to represent Argentina in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the 2011 Copa America, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa America, and the Copa America Centenario, reaching the finals of the latter three tournaments.</p>
            
            <p id="Morata" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%; margin: 0 20px;">Alvaro Morata</p>
            <p>Alvaro Borja Morata Martin (born 23 October 1992) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a striker for English club Chelsea and the Spain national team.</p>

            <p>He began his career at Real Madrid, making his debut with the senior team in late 2010 and going on to appear in 52 official games (11 goals), notably winning the 2014 Champions League. He moved to Juventus for €20 million in 2014, winning the domestic double of Serie A and Coppa Italia in both of his seasons before being bought back for €30 million. With Real, Morata won another La Liga and Champions League before joining Chelsea in 2017 for £58 million.</p>

            <p>Morata earned 50 caps for Spain at youth level, helping the country win the 2013 European Under-21 Championship. He made his senior debut in 2014, representing the nation at Euro 2016.</p>
            
            <p>Morata was called by the Spain under-17 team for the 2009 FIFA World Cup in Nigeria, playing four matches and scoring two goals for the third-placed team. Subsequently, he represented the under-19s at the Japan International Tournament, helping to a second-place finish after the hosts.</p>
            
            <p>Morata was selected by Spain to the squad that appeared in the 2011 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Romania, helping the national team win the tournament with six goals, the highest in the competition. He made his debut with the under-21s at the 2013 European Championships in Israel, being essential in the first two group games against Russia and Germany by netting the solitary goal in each contest, respectively in the 82nd and 86th minutes; he closed out a perfect group stage for both team and player with his third, against the Netherlands (3–0)– eventually he was crowned the competition's top scorer, and it also ended in conquest.</p>
            
            <p>On 7 November 2014, Morata was called up to senior team manager Vicente del Bosque's squad for matches against Belarus and Germany. He made his debut against the former on the 15th, replacing Isco for the last ten minutes of a 3–0 win in Huelva for the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers; in the same competition, on 27 March 2015, he scored his first senior international goal, the only in a victory over Ukraine in Seville.</p>

            <p>Selected for the finals in France, Morata started and scored a brace in a 3–0 group stage win against Turkey in Nice. On 2 September 2017, coming from the bench in the 77th minute, Morata netted once to help the hosts defeat Italy 3–0 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.</p>
            
            <p>Good in the air and at holding up the ball, with clinical finishing ability, quick feet and excellent movement, in his youth Morata drew comparisons to Real Madrid and Spain's Fernando Morientes due to his playing style. During his first season at Juventus, he stood out for his pace, energy and work-rate on the pitch, while his technique, opportunism and positional sense saw him score several crucial goals.</p>

            <p>A versatile and well-rounded forward, Morata is capable of playing as a main striker or linking up play between the lines, and can even play out wide on the wing. He is also an accurate penalty taker.</p>
