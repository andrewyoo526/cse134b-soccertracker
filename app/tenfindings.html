        <ol reversed>
            <li>MathML isn't supported by Chrome, Edge, IE. But is supported by Safari, and FireFox</li>
            <li>It's cool how an href attribute can handle both local files and external urls</li>
            <li>The importance of 'meta' tags for SEO and the undervalued and unknown this tag is</li>
            <li>There are many ways to manipulate the text on the page such that you see words crossed out, emphasized words, inserted words and even texts that are linked</li>
            <li>W3schools isn't always reliable, sometimes their examples are not in properly formed html</li>
            <li>There was much more inconsistencies between browsers on implementation and support than expected</li>
            <li>Most of the tag attributes related with visual design are not longer supported in HTML5 because it was redundant (for those purposes we use CSS)</li>
            <li>Bold and Strong tags do not have the same purpose. While in bold you just want to highlight a word, strong is an indication of how something should be understood. It can mean "bold" in a browser, but it is also represented in some way for PDA's or devices for blind people</li>
            <li>You can place Javascript from events in the script section within the html, which holds code similar to other programming languages. </li>
            <li>Different event functions can occur depending on how the user interacts with the elements of the page. This includes the user clicking on buttons, pressing keys, or even just loading the page. </li>
